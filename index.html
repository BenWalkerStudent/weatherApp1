                <h3>Purpose</h3>
                <p>The goal of this project is to build a web site that you build completely on your own. Use some of
                    the skills you've learned from the HTML Cat Photo App project to build a project that will be
                    improved on via CSS in the coming weeks. You will want to use as much knowledge as you have for your
                    project so that you're applying all that you've learned and are able to use that information
                    effectively when creating websites.</p>
